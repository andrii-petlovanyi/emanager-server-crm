# emanager-server-crm

Hey hey hey! 

This is small RESTFull API for EManager CRM client. More about this project you can read on [page](https://github.com/andrii-petlovanyi/emanager-cl-crm "EManager CRM client page")
This API was written using ***MongoDB/Express/Node.js***. The production and test versions of this project works on my VPS.

You can run this project on your machine, but first edit the ***.envExample*** file by entering your credentials and rename file on '.env'.

Thanks for your interest)
